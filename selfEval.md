1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
   * I feel very confident with logical operators.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
   * I feel decently confident with if statements. I think I need more practice with the syntax of them but I will make some time to practice.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
   *  I spent probably 3.5 on the lesson and CFU. I spent more time on this than I expected.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
